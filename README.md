# Genetic Playground

Having been inspired by a paper (*Genetic Algorithms* by John H. Holland), I'm going to try my hand at this.

The first thing I'm going to experiment with is the *Prisoner's Dilemma*, in order to see if I can reproduce the results in the paper using a more abstract system than string representation. I think modern languages (and in particular Kotlin) offer the potential to do the Genetic Programming described in the paper in a more intuitive way than is described in the paper.
