# Genetic Playground

Having been inspired by a paper ([*Genetic Algorithms* by John H. Holland](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/holland.GAIntro.htm)), I'm going to try my hand at this.

**Goal:** A personal (toy, for now) framework which can solve problems using a Genetic Programming approach, as described in the paper above.

**Status:** I have begun implementing the Prisoner's Dilemma example from the paper, but it is in the very earliest stages. It is a dense paper and will take awhile to get through, but it is full of really good stuff.
