# Genetic Playground

Having been inspired by a paper ([*Genetic Algorithms* by John H. Holland](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/holland.GAIntro.htm)), I'm going to try my hand at this.

**Goal:** A personal (toy, for now) framework which can solve problems using a Genetic Programming approach, as described in the paper above.

**Status:** Currently, this plays the game of Prisoner's Dilemma using Classifiers (the "chromosomes" of Holland's paper) to represent the rules and the genetic algorithm described in the paper to enforce selection. It does not use the same criteria for decision-making in play that the paper used, as I have opted to do something a little different, but the way in which the genetic algorithm behaves is the same. The way these classifiers make decisions is probabilistic and reproduces some of the same strategies which are known to be effective and emerge from these lower-level Characteristics (the "genes" of Holland's paper). Right now the best way to observe it is to run it with verbose output and watch the numbers, but the next step is to implement file outputs which actually yield useful, easily-parsed data which I can put in to a graph visualization program. I may also take the time to put a graphical front-end on it using Compose Multiplatform, but that's a very low priority compared to improving the codebase and writing some more complex experiments with other games (though it will happen at some point). There are many more advanced ideas in the paper which I have not touched on yet, but intend to. Very neat stuff in there.
